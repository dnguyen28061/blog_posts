Project: Node.js Blog with Database Comparison
1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Requirements
The core goal of this project is to create a minimally functional web application that demonstrates basic data operations for a blog. The UI will be simple, focusing on the backend logic.

Core Features
Create: A user can create a new blog post via a simple form. A post will contain a title, author, and content.

Read (All): The home page displays a list of all existing blog post titles.

Read (Single): Clicking on a post title navigates the user to a page that displays the full post content.

Update: A user can edit an existing post.

Delete: A user can delete a post.

Technical Stack
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for the server and API routes.

Frontend: A minimal HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI to interact with the backend. All styling will be inline or in a single <style> tag for simplicity.

Databases:

PostgreSQL (Relational)

MongoDB (Document)

Cassandra (Column-Family)
