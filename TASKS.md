1.1. Detailed MVP Implementation Tasks
To achieve the MVP, the following tasks should be completed for each database implementation:

Backend Tasks (Node.js & Express.js)
Project Setup:

Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init -y.

Install core dependencies: npm install express dotenv.

Install the appropriate database driver (e.g., pg for PostgreSQL).

Server Development:

Create a server.js file to set up the Express application.

Configure middleware for parsing JSON and serving static files.

Initialize the database connection using environment variables from a .env file.

Set up the server to listen on a designated port.

API Endpoints:

Create a POST /api/posts endpoint to handle creating new posts.

Create a GET /api/posts endpoint to retrieve and return a list of all posts.

Create a GET /api/posts/:id endpoint to fetch a single post by its ID.

Create a PUT /api/posts/:id endpoint to handle updating an existing post.

Create a DELETE /api/posts/:id endpoint to remove a post from the database.

Frontend Tasks (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript)
File Structure:

Create a public directory.

Inside public, create an index.html file.

HTML Structure:

Design the main page with a form for creating new blog posts (input fields for title, author, and content).

Add a section to display the list of existing blog post titles.

Include basic UI elements for viewing and editing a single post.

Client-Side Logic:

Write JavaScript to handle form submission, sending data to the POST /api/posts endpoint.

Implement a function to fetch all posts from GET /api/posts and dynamically render them on the page.

Add event listeners to the post titles so that clicking on one triggers a fetch to GET /api/posts/:id and displays the full content.

Create a function to handle updating a post, sending data to the PUT endpoint.

Create a function to handle deleting a post, sending a request to the DELETE endpoint.

Styling:

Add a <style> tag in the HTML file or use Tailwind classes to provide a clean and minimal UI.

2. General Implementation Steps (Common to All Databases)
Regardless of the database used, the initial setup will be the same.

Project Initialization: Create a new Node.js project directory and run npm init -y.

Install Express: Install the Express framework for building the web server: npm install express.

Environment Variables: Use the dotenv package to manage database connection strings: npm install dotenv.

Server Setup: Create a central server.js file with a basic Express server configuration, including middleware for handling JSON requests.

UI Files: Create a public directory to serve static HTML files for the UI. The UI will have a form to create/update posts and a list to view them.

3. Database-Specific Implementation Plans
Each version of the project will have its own set of dependencies and data modeling strategies.

A. PostgreSQL (Relational)
PostgreSQL is a powerful, traditional relational database. We will use a standard table to store our blog posts.

Dependencies:

pg (official Node.js client)

You may also consider an ORM like Sequelize for more complex projects, but for this MVP, the pg client is sufficient.

Data Modeling: A single posts table will be created.

CREATE TABLE posts (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(255), author VARCHAR(100), content TEXT);

Implementation Steps:

Install the pg package: npm install pg.

Configure a Client or Pool in your server.js file using your connection string.

Define API routes (/api/posts, /api/posts/:id) that use client.query() to perform CRUD operations with SQL statements.

The backend will handle all database interactions. The front end will send and receive JSON data.

B. MongoDB (Document)
MongoDB is a NoSQL document database, allowing for flexible, JSON-like data structures.

Dependencies:

mongoose (an object data modeling library for MongoDB)

Data Modeling: Data will be stored in a posts collection.

title, author, and content fields will be part of a single document.

Mongoose schemas will enforce a structure for the documents.

Implementation Steps:

Install the mongoose package: npm install mongoose.

Connect to your MongoDB database using mongoose.connect().

Define a Mongoose schema for the Post model.

Implement API routes that use Mongoose methods like Post.find(), Post.findById(), new Post().save(), Post.findByIdAndUpdate(), and Post.findByIdAndDelete() to interact with the database.

C. Apache Cassandra (Column-Family)
Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database, optimized for high-write throughput and massive scale. Data modeling is query-driven.

Dependencies:

cassandra-driver (the official Node.js driver)

Data Modeling: A table in Cassandra is a denormalized view of the data. A simple posts_by_id table will be used.

A posts keyspace is first created.

CREATE TABLE posts_by_id (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, author TEXT, content TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP);

Implementation Steps:

Install the cassandra-driver package: npm install cassandra-driver.

Connect to your Cassandra cluster using the Client object.

Implement API routes that use client.execute() with CQL (Cassandra Query Language) statements. This is similar to SQL but tailored for Cassandra's data model. You will use INSERT, SELECT, and DELETE queries.

Note that UPDATE operations are handled differently in Cassandra. You would typically perform a full row update.
